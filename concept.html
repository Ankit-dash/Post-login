                        </div>
                            <p class="p-1 text-dark">In economics, a time-based currency is an exchange system where the unit of account is the
                                person-hour or some other time unit. Some time-based currencies value everyone's
                                contributions equally: one hour equals one service credit. In this system, one person volunteers
                                to work for an hour for another person; thus, they are credited with one hour, which they can
                                redeem for an hour of service from another member.It is a reciprocity-based work trading
                                system in which hours are the currency.</p>

                                <p class="p-1 text-dark">It is a system of bartering various services for one another using labor-time as a unit of account
                                which was developed by various socialist thinkers based on the labor theory of value. Their
                                units can be credited to a person’s account in the time bank and redeemed for services from
                                other members of the time bank. It can be considered a form of community currency. However,
                                because the labor-time units of account are not generally accepted outside the membership of
                                the time bank, nor for general goods traded in the market other than specific labor services, it
                                does not constitute a form of money in an economic sense outside the inherently limited context
                                of the time bank itself.</p>
                                <p class="p-1 text-dark">In a time-banking environment, people receive labor-time credits when they provide a service to
                                another member of the time bank. Every hour of time is just valued the same, regardless of the
                                service rendered. In theory, any type of service can be exchanged for another.
                                It uses modern technology to try to introduce the secondary functions of money to formalize and
                                regulate the practice of trading favors and mutual or social obligations. It functions as a hybrid
                                system between a true monetary economy of indirect exchange and a reciprocal gift economy
                                characteristic of informal, pre-capitalist, and primitive economies. As such, it can have some of
                                the advantages and disadvantages of both types of economic systems.</p>
                                <p class="p-1 text-dark"> It is promoted as helping to foster community ties and encourage people who would not
                                normally get involved in traditional volunteering. It seeks to overcome the problems of the social
                                and economic alienation between producers and consumers that is widely believed to
                                characterize industrial capitalist economies and has often formed the rationale for social unrest
                                and revolutionary communism. It formally and tangibly recognizes the economic value of labor
                                services that are not traditionally traded in the formal monetary economy but that often form the
                                basis of valuable social capital.</p>

                                isolation back radical solutions emphasize its advantages in building community, inclusion,
                                volunteerism, and social assistance. It is promoted as helping to foster community ties and
                                encourage people who would not normally get involved in traditional volunteering. It seeks to
                                overcome the problems of the social and economic alienation between producers and

                                monetary economy but that often form the basis of valuable social capital. Above all, it has been
                                championed for enabling people with low incomes to access services that would be
                                unaffordable to them in the traditional market economy.
                                Critics also fear that time banking could distort market
                                forces, causing economic problems. However, with the
                                economic problems already stemming from free market
                                economies in recent years, the system is often seen as more
                                of a solution than a threat. It is a way of spending one hour
                                of time helping someone out by, for example, mowing
                                someone’s lawn, or doing their shopping. For every hour
                                spent, you earn an hour in return. This can be spent on
                                receiving an hour of someone else’s time or, where
                                available, things like theatre or cinema tickets. You could
                                learn something new or share a skill you have like cooking or
                                playing a musical instrument.</p>
                                <p class="p-1 text-dark">The stagnant state of the global economy has worked in time banks’ favour. People are
                                increasingly keen to find alternative ways of leveraging their skills and resources through the
                                crowd economy. For instance, if you can’t find someone who’ll pay you cash to teach them a
                                language or mentor their child, why not see if you can find someone who’ll pay you in time?
                                In future, time banks could be a valuable means for people to ‘pay in’ time in their youth and
                                spend it in their old age. Time banks could also help to plug gaps in public service provision,
                                ensuring people are still cared for when the state isn’t up to the task.
                                Life has changed and our friends and family do not always live nearby. It is not so easy to ask
                                neighbours for help these days, particularly if we do not know if we can ever pay them back.We
                                believe that every person in society is of value no matter what their age or ability. Everyone has
                                knowledge and experience and every person has the ability to help someone</p>

                                so familiar to us that, like chefs with the spices, we hardly even see it for what it is. What we
                                don’t always recognize is that the money economy we have created is just one part of the way
                                we organize our affairs. There is another, invisible economy that we take part in every day of
                                our lives. It is the economy of home, family, neighborhood and community. We don’t think of it
                                as an economic system—but it is. It is so important that it deserves the name that economist
                                Neva Goodwin gave it when she called it the “Core” economy.</p>
                                <p class="p-1 text-dark">In this economy we take price for granted. We know that when goods are scarce, prices go up
                                    and when they are plentiful, the prices go back down. It is hard for us to think about the
                                    economy without thinking about price. Price is the way that our society uses to insure that we
                                    give and get “fair value” for what we buy, sell and trade.</p>
                                <p class="p-1 text-dark">What we don’t recognize as clearly is that in the money economy, price also applies to all the
                                    things that make us human. The ability to care for others is something that all of us have, and
                                    this means that in terms of money, it is worth very little.Because of price, the money economy
                                    does not value the kind of work it takes to create healthy homes, families and communities.
                                    Price is unable to mirror the social value of the work that we do in the Core Economy.What we
                                    forget is that you don’t need to have money with price built into it to have an economy. The
                                    exchanges are built on a sense of obligation and reciprocity, not price or supply and demand.</p>
                                <p class="p-1 text-dark"> Time Banking takes the basic ideas of Co-Production and builds on the fact that people
                                    naturally want to give back, to make a difference, just as professional providers do.Lets take the
                                    Five Core Values of Time Banking and apply them to the basic idea of Co-Production in the
                                    fields of social services to create a renewed sense of membership, belonging and joint
                                    ownership in positive outcomes. This calls for all of the Five Core Values means that-<br>
                                    ● Clients become valued as assets.<br>
                                    ● Their contributions are valued – and rewarded – as real work.<br>
                                    ● Reciprocity between clients and professionals leads to mutually rewarding support and
                                    stronger outcomes all round.<br>
                                    ● Clients and service providers all contribute in ways that build a web of mutual support.<br>
                                    ● There is respect for each and for what each brings to the table.<br>

                                <p class="p-1 text-dark">When paid work consumes more and more of our waking lives, it is not only the homes, families
                                    and neighborhoods of the people on the lowest end of the financial spectrum who suffer.Many
                                    of us are struggling with too few social support to maintain safe and vibrant communities, raise
                                    our young, and care for our elders.<p>
                                    <p class="p-1 text-dark">We also see how the monetary economy picks and chooses the people, communities and
                                    specialized skills it needs. Those with plenty of marketable skills and resources find it easier to
                                    get more. The people who do not have money or marketable skills—the poor, the elderly, the
                                    frail, the uneducated—fall between the cracks with no place, no role, and no money to buy what
                                    they need. Families and whole communities have been shut out of the mainstream economy
                                    over generations. The strain on them is immense—and frequently spills over into the society at
                                    large.</p>
                                    <p class="p-1 text-dark"> Every hour you spend sharing a skill or performing a service for another time bank member can

                                    members for their skills and services.</p>
                                    <p class="p-1 text-dark">It’s a little like using time as a currency, but it’s so much more than that — time banking makes

                            <p class="p-1 text-dark">The liberal international order (LIO) is in crisis.At the heart of the need for a comprehensive
                                crisis analysis is the long-term nature of the crisis itself. If the crisis of the LIO did indeed begin
                                somewhere around the Great Recession, we need to provide an interpretative framework that
                                will enable us to understand the crisis better as a distinct and decisive period for world affairs. If
                                we furthermore think about when we might realistically expect to see the advent of a new,
                                hegemonically stable world order, the time-span of the crisis extends further. In the meantime,
                                significant global processes are taking place. Analysing these processes only from a historical
                                or future-orientated perspective fails to grasp their impact on present power relations and the
                                crisis through which we are living. In order to make educated guesses about the future of world
                                order, it is crucial that we gain a better understanding and analysis of its current crisis.</p>

                                <p class="p-1 text-dark">There is, then, ample reason to study the crisis of the LIO for itself; however, the attempt to do
                                    so faces particular difficulties. Fundamental political crises are often perceived as ‘black swan’
                                    events that challenge well-established modes of thinking and generalizing and often even
                                    render them obsolete; the crisis appears as the manifestation of historical randomness.The
                                    result is that severe political and economic crises provoke perplexity and a flood of alternative
                                    explanations about what went wrong and how to fix it.As scholarship in international political
                                    economy (IPE) has demonstrated, crises are thus often interpreted from either ‘old’ and
                                    vanishing analytical frameworks and ‘historical imaginations’, or from new perspectives that
                                    arise out of the crisis of the old.Gramsci-inspired framework offers tools to overcome this
                                    analytical problem. By analysing the crisis as a distinct phase of instability and uncertainty, we
                                    are able to ‘zoom in’ on the particularity and idiosyncrasy of the crisis of the LIO. With Gramsci,
                                    we are able to think through the organic multidimensionality of a crisis, and are given words and
                                    concepts that enable us to assess this complexity in an appropriate way, as the empirical entry
                                    points described in this article show.</p>
                                <p class="p-1 text-dark">On the material side there are international institutions like the World Bank and the IMF,
                                    multilateral cooperation in various policy fields, a specific market-based economic model, and
                                    also an implicit and often explicit ranking order of state power, leadership and responsibility,
                                    headed by the United States. This material structure is understood as flowing from, or at least
                                    being grounded in, a broader ‘set of ideas, principles and political agendas for organizing and
                                    reforming international order’, which is liberal institutionalism.</p>
                                <p class="p-1 text-dark">Processuality, organicity, morbidity<br>
                                    Gramsci's prison notebooks represent a running commentary on the crisis of liberalism and the
                                    Italian state during the last grand transition of world order in the 1920s and 1930s. While
                                    Gramsci did not develop a crisis theory himself, his thinking can be described as crisis-driven,
                                    as it evolves through the many crises of the national and international spheres during these
                                    decades of social and political turmoil. This crisis-driven thinking can serve to equip our
                                    theoretical toolkit in analysing the current multidimensional crisis of the LIO.Processuality at the
                                    global political economy level, organicity at the state level and morbidity at the societal level.
                                    This threefold division structures the subsequent analytical framework and helps us to identify
                                    empirically accessible moments in the crisis of the LIO.The connection of each of the different
                                    levels to the relevant IPE and International Relations scholarship on crisis in order to emphasize
                                    that a Gramscian framework is compatible with existing work on the matter and hence pertinent
                                    for a broader audience beyond a Gramscian perspective.</p>
                                <p class="p-1 text-dark">A first and most fundamental aspect of Gramsci's thinking on this subject is that he understood
                                    crises not as static ‘events’, but as processes.This means, first, that crises are not framed as
                                    external shocks or exogenous events that break into a social order. Crises have in this sense a
                                    ‘history’, since they originate in contradictions or tensions in the old, dying social order. For
                                    Gramsci, those were mainly contradictions that capitalism itself created. If crises are not
                                    reducible to single, exogenous events, they represent more than just a single moment
                                    separating the old from the new order. They are, rather, long, multidimensional and
                                    transformative processes of economic and political insecurity that can last for decades, and can
                                    develop a ‘life’ of their own. Both points emphasize the centrality of historical accounts in
                                    studying this ‘life’ of a crisis. In this article, processuality is understood as a feature of crisis on
                                    the macro level of the global political economy: it is here that the long-term, structural changes
                                    and crisis developments are analytically located.</p>

                                <p class="p-1 text-dark">In the existing literature, Stuart Hall was the first to emphasize such a Gramscian understanding
                                    of crisis. He understood crisis as the condensation of underlying societal contradictions that
                                    move history from one conjuncture to the next.A crisis is always ‘overdetermined’, given that a
                                    variety of long-term contradictions culminate in a distinct crisis phase.The processuality of the
                                    crisis has a productive aspect that pushes the boundaries of the existing order, since ‘every
                                    crisis is also a moment of reconstruction’.In the case of the LIO, this means that there is more
                                    than one long-term process determining the current crisis , and that the current crisis is
                                    producing new political realities that merit analysis in their own right.</p>
                                <p class="p-1 text-dark">The distinction between what Gramsci described as ‘conjunctural’ and ‘organic’
                                    crises.Conjunctural crisis are those that appear in daily political life; they are usually of a less
                                    fundamental nature and, on their own, not system-changing. Only organic crises challenge the
                                    very fundamentals on which social orders are built. They produce the ‘morbid symptoms’ that
                                    disrupt everyday political and economic life and, in the long run, destroy old societal orders and
                                    power relations. For Gramsci, organic crises are rooted in an alienation of the masses from their
                                    political representation, giving rise to a mismatch between ‘represented and
                                    representatives’.The ‘mummified and anachronistic’ actors of the past are not able to solve the
                                    crisis within the framework of this dying order. This in turn leads to a ‘crisis of authority’ that
                                    leaves an ideological void and thus the possibility for different crisis solutions. In the case of the
                                    LIO, this mismatch concerns the proponents of an international order and those it ought to
                                    represent, namely the states that are part of this order. This mismatch arises if states withdraw
                                    their support for core elements of the LIO, such as economic openness or security cooperation.
                                    The most unequivocal way to do this is at the ballot box, electing leaders and political
                                    representatives who programmatically reject and deprecate those elements. The crisis of
                                    authority arises because the withdrawal of states from the LIO leaves a void on the international
                                    stage that cannot be resolved within the old framework and by the old actors that represent the
                                    dying order. This national–international divide constitutes the organic crisis of the LIO: the old
                                    order loses its legitimacy and its supporting states do not offer a solution, but orientate
                                    themselves away from its core elements.</p>
                                    <p class="p-1 text-dark">The third point relates to what Gramsci describes as ‘morbid symptoms’. This term is part of his
                                    famous definition of crisis of authority: ‘The crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is
                                    dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms
                                    appear.’The morbidity of the ‘symptoms’ stems from their identification as outgrowths of the
                                    ‘dying’ order. The symptoms are morbid because they show that the existing order suffers from
                                    existential problems that are unlikely to be solved within the limits of the old framework. At the
                                    same time, a new, hegemonically stable order does not seem to be on the rise, ready to
                                    supplant the old one. This crisis period is thus shaped by morbidities that cannot be managed
                                    ut at the same time do not represent a viable alternative for the future.<br>
                                    But if we translate this pattern to the level of world order, we can see a number of phenomena—for
                                    example, the rise of political leaders who undermine existing institutions and rules; an open
                                    hostility towards principles such as multilateral cooperation; and an emptying of core values
                                    such as democratic solidarity—as moments of morbidity that cannot be captured by the logic of
                                    the LIO itself. They represent problematic developments that erode the LIO without offering a
                                    new stable equilibrium that could replace the old order. The framework presented in this article
                                    is set out not to describe those symptoms, but to systematically trace the sources of these
                                    morbidities within the changing cultural and socio-economic dynamics at work on the societal
                                    level. In order to make sense of morbid symptoms, analysis should aim above all at
                                    understanding their drivers. Those drivers manifest themselves in the gradual—passive or
                                    active—corrosion of the values and attitudes supporting the LIO that in turn feeds the
                                    morbidities undermining that order. The analysis of these sources of the present morbidities is a
                                    multidisciplinary undertaking: as emphasized by Gramsci, an organic crisis manifests itself
                                    across the range of societal spheres, including politics, culture and the economy.Its analysis
                                    hence needs to take into account different discursive, political and economic factors in order to
                                    trace the sources of these morbid symptoms.
                                    <p class="p-1 text-dark"> The three elements of a crisis analysis sketched out above can serve as analytical tools to
                                    understand the crisis of the LIO from a crisis-centred perspective. The idea is not to give an
                                    account of the crisis itself, but to offer a coherent approach to studying it. After all, the current
                                    crisis of world order is too complex and too long standing to be susceptible to a single
                                    explanation.</p>
                                    <p class="p-1 text-dark">Taken together, the three areas of possible empirical investigation—the political economy of
                                    global populism, and the discursive and material foundations of the erosion of the LIO—open
                                    the way to a better understanding of the national–international nexus as the basis for the
                                    organicity of the crisis. They illustrate that this current crisis of the LIO is a systemic,
                                    multidimensional phenomenon that is not likelyto be resolved as a conjunctural crisis could be.</p>

                                    <p class="p-1 text-dark">The ‘material’ erosion of a common civic identity is, from a Gramscian perspective, at least as
                                    important as the discursive changes of everyday narratives described above. Beyond its
                                    analytical value, a class focus allows us to understand the emancipatory potential of new
                                    identities forged out of the crisis of the LIO and the relevance of this potential for other subaltern
                                    groups that are being marginalized in the current far-right populist version of a new identity.
                                    The stance taken here also implies a more rigorous and analytically restrained approach to
                                    questions of a future world order: a redirection of research efforts into understanding the present
                                    rather than predicting the future is a promising strategy to produce better insights into the social
                                    dynamics that are drastically changing the face of world order and societies around the globe.
                                    Thinking along these lines with Gramsci can help us to make sense of what might otherwise at
                                    times present an incoherent and morbid picture.</p>
